# STEPS

Firstly, I made the Python application that prints "Hello DOcker" to the console. I simply opened a new .py fiel and put print "Hello Docker" in it.

Next I made a new folder named Dontext and in it I created the Dockerfile. In the Dockerfile I put all the necessary commands to complete the task. The order of the commands is: 
1. Use the ubuntu image as a base-image.
2. Describe what the container will do.
3. Add the python application in the image filesystem.
4. Update and install the Python so that the application can be run.
